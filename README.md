# Swing-up-of-the-Swirling-Pendulum
Run 'Maincode.m'

Uses a Lyapunov-based non-linear control law to achieve swing-up of the Swirling Pendulum (a two-link underactuated mechanism). Addresses the challenge of loss of inertial coupling. Uses state-based switching to ensure convergence and reduce the time for swing-up (to less than one-fifth as per the simulations)
